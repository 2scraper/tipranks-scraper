"""scraper_api_client.py — the browserless HTTP client for 2Captcha's REST
surface. No site knowledge. `captcha_solver.py` and `fingerprint_client.py`
both sit on top of this rather than calling `requests` directly, so there is
exactly one place that knows the base URL, auth shape and error envelope.
Copied near-verbatim from the newest sibling (shein-scraper) per CLAUDE.md
§7 — see that repo for where each product below was actually confirmed
live; none of it has been exercised against tipranks.com yet (added to
this repo 2026-09-28, see CHANGELOG.md and TESTING.md).

Covers four of 2Captcha's five separately-billed products behind one key
(the fifth, proxies, is `proxy_pool.py` + TIPRANKS_PROXY — a 2captcha.com/
proxy credential, 2prx.com is a synonym for the same product, not a
separate host):

  - classic captcha solving (createTask / getTaskResult)
  - the Scraping Browser API (POST /browser/connection -> a CDP URL)
  - the Fingerprint API (GET /fingerprint/random)
  - the Scraper API (POST https://scraper.2captcha.com/tasks/sync). A
    GENUINELY DIFFERENT product from the Scraping Browser API above, and
    easy to confuse with it: the Scraping Browser API hands this process
    a CDP URL and WE drive a real Playwright/Selenium/Puppeteer browser
    against it; the Scraper API instead runs the fetch ENTIRELY on
    2Captcha's own infrastructure (their own headless browser, not ours)
    and hands back the rendered HTML/Markdown/screenshot over a single
    HTTP call — no local or remote browser session on our end at all.
    Lives on its own hostname (`scraper.2captcha.com`, not
    `api.2captcha.com`) with its own Bearer-token auth, which is why it
    gets its own `scraper_api_base` override rather than reusing
    `self.api_base`. Confirmed live against shein.com (a sibling repo, a
    genuinely different site with a genuinely different fetch shape —
    see `_scrape_via_scraper_api()`'s module comment in each engine for
    why this repo points it at `ticker_payload_url()`, not the page URL);
    NOT yet exercised against tipranks.com. `scrape_url()`'s `cdp_url`
    parameter (below), which every engine's `--scraper-api-cdp` fills,
    routes this fetch through 2Captcha's own Scraping Browser instead of
    their default pool — real captcha auto-solve happens on 2Captcha's
    side of that session, before anything reaches this repo.

Never construct a competitor's API call from this module.
